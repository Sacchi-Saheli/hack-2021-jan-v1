# Sacchi Saheli Hack 2021 Project

In third world countries like India, entrepreneurship is still a male dominated field where the female contribution is almost negligible. One of the major reasons is the unavailability of resources and no exposure at the highest level of leadership and business management.
SACHI SAHELI provides a platform where rural women are provided with ample opportunities; by connecting them with the investors all over the world who wish to invest in their talent and home-made products which would be appreciated all over the globe.

Important Challenges that rural women face on the road of entrepreneurship:	
	
 <ul>
      <li>Problems with traditional mindset of women being restricted to the household work</li>	
      <li>Lack of technical knowledge</li>	  
      <li>Lack of financial education</li>	  
      <li>Lack of resources</li>	  	
      <li>Low connectivity issues.</li>	  		
 </ul>

## How Are Project Helps with These Problems?

<ul>
  <li> We provide an open market to all these women who register themselves on our application. In this marketplace they have access to all kinds of buyers, thus empowering their business further. </li>  		
  <li> We have made it as a very light application, thus it can be run even on slow internet. In today's time internet has reached even the remote places of our country, and thus helps promote our agenda even further.</li>
  <li> This web application is easy to use, and also has a very soft learning curve. Hence it doesn't need any prerequisites from the user.</li> 
  <li> We have provided blogs, which in future will be available in all languages. These blogs will help in educating rural women about financial independence, expansion of business, consolidation of resources and many other such things related to business and finance.</li>
</ul>

## Future Prospects
  ### Tech Stack
  We have completed only the front end development phase of the project, and thus it's still a <strong> work in progress </strong>. However in future we are planning on incorporating Blockchain technology for transactions and payments. The code will be restructured using ReactJS.
  
  ### General
  We hope that in future this app is used widely, and it helps not only women of rural class, but all women who believe in their ideas, and want to capitalize their product.
